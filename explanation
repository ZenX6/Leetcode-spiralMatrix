Let's break down the spiralOrder function step by step, using the algorithm described:

1. Initialization
We start by initializing four boundaries:

top starts at 0, indicating the top-most unprocessed row.
bottom starts at matrix.length - 1, indicating the bottom-most unprocessed row.
left starts at 0, indicating the left-most unprocessed column.
right starts at matrix[0].length - 1, indicating the right-most unprocessed column.
2. Begin Loop
We begin a loop that continues as long as the top boundary doesn't cross the bottom boundary, and the left boundary doesn't cross the right boundary.

3. Traverse Right
For i from left to right:

Push matrix[top][i] to the result array.
This will cover the topmost row of the current "layer" of the matrix.
After processing, increment the top boundary, effectively ignoring this row in subsequent loops.

4. Traverse Down
For i from top to bottom:

Push matrix[i][right] to the result array.
This will cover the rightmost column of the current "layer" of the matrix.
After processing, decrement the right boundary, effectively ignoring this column in subsequent loops.

5. Traverse Left
Before doing this step, we ensure top is still less than or equal to bottom.

For i from right to left:

Push matrix[bottom][i] to the result array.
This covers the bottom-most row of the current "layer" of the matrix.
After processing, decrement the bottom boundary, effectively ignoring this row in subsequent loops.

6. Traverse Up
Before doing this step, we ensure left is still less than or equal to right.

For i from bottom to top:

Push matrix[i][left] to the result array.
This covers the leftmost column of the current "layer" of the matrix.
After processing, increment the left boundary, effectively ignoring this column in subsequent loops.

7. Repeat
The loop goes back to step 3 and continues the process for the next inner "layer" of the matrix. This continues until all "layers" have been processed.

8. Return the Result
After all layers have been processed and the loop exits, we simply return the result array which now contains elements in the desired spiral order.

Example with matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]:

Right: Add 1, 2, 3
Down: Add 6, 9
Left: Add 8, 7
Up: Add 4
Right (next layer): Add 5
The result is: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5], which is the desired spiral order.
